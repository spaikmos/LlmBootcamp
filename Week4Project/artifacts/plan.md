   - Navigation links ("Login" and "Sign up") on the right.

2. **Hero Section**:
   - Centralized bold text: "Don't make connecting awkward."
   - Subtext explaining the service.
   - A prominent "Sign up free" button.
   - Decorative background with abstract shapes.

3. **Image Section**:

### Layout Considerations

- **Flexbox or Grid**: Use CSS Flexbox for the header and footer for easy alignment. The hero and "How It Works" sections can benefit from CSS Grid for structured layout.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure the design is mobile-friendly, with elements stacking vertically on smaller screens.
- **Background Shapes**: Use CSS for decorative shapes to maintain scalability and performance.
